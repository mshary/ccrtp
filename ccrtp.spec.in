%description
GNU ccRTP is a generic, extensible and efficient C++ framework for
developing applications based on the Real-Time Transport Protocol
(RTP) from the IETF. It is based on Common C++ and provides a full
RTP/RTCP stack for sending and receiving of realtime data by the use
of send and receive packet queues. ccRTP supports unicast,
multi-unicast and multicast, manages multiple sources, handles RTCP
automatically, supports different threading models and is generic as
for underlying network and transport protocols.
