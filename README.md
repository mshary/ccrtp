# GNU ccRTP - GNU RTP Stack
Please visit official site of [GNU ccRTP](https://www.gnu.org/software/ccrtp/) for detailed description of the library.

This repository is forked from ccRTP v2.1.2 which was released in 2017 and does not seems to be under active development anymore. Mainly the support for OpenSSL v1.1.x was missing along with some other compiler errors etc. on modern platforms like Ubuntu 20.04. Since this is a very fast and efficient library with minimal memory footprint, therefore, I decided to fix all build errors and fork it here on Github for public use. Please see LICENSE and AUTHORS for legal information and copyrights or visit official site of [GNU RTP Stack](https://www.gnu.org/software/ccrtp/).
